# Contributing

## Workflow & Protections

* PRs only; no direct pushes to `main`.

* Squash merge only; please write a clear PR title (it becomes the commit message).

* At least 1 reviewer approval; resolve all conversations before merge.

* CI jobs: `build`, `lint`, `test` must pass when enforced.

* Details: see [Repository Settings & Rules](docs/maintainers/repo-settings.md).
